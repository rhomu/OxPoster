\abstract{%
Experimental studies have uncovered the role of intrinsic wave generation in developmental processes during morphogenesis.
Different mechanisms based on reaction-diffusion dynamics of chemical signalling have been traditionally suggested to govern such phenomena.
Here, we demonstrate that an alternative mechanical route for wave generation exists in confined monolayers.
By introducing an individual-based computational model that incorporates steric interactions, adhesion, as well as mechanical properties of individual cells, we are able to study the dynamics of cells in confinement.
We observe many phenomena of interest, such as circulation, sustained oscillations and travelling waves. Furthermore, we analyse recent experimental data and show good agreement with our model.
